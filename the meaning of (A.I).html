Artificial intelligence is a technology that is already impacting how users interact with,
 and are affected by the Internet. In the near future,
 its impact is likely to only continue to grow. AI has the potential to vastly change the way that humans interact
 , not only with the digital world, but also with each other, through their work and through other socioeconomic institutions â€“
 for better or for worse.
